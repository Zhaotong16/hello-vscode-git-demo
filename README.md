# Hello VS Code + Git Demo

This is my personal practice project to learn Git and GitHub using Visual Studio Code.

## What I Did
- Cloned a GitHub repo using VS Code
- Edited files and committed changes with clear messages
- Pushed updates back to GitHub from the VS Code interface

## Skills Practiced
- Git basics (clone, add, commit, push)
- Using VS Code Source Control panel
- Writing README files in Markdown

## Next Steps
- Try Git branching
- Start a real data science project from scratch!
